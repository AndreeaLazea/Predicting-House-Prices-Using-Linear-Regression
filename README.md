# House Price Prediction

This project is a Python-based tool that predicts house prices using a linear regression model. The model is built on features like the size of the house, number of bedrooms, and the age of the house. It demonstrates basic data manipulation, numerical operations, and machine learning with Python.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, normalizes features, and prepares data for model training.
- **Machine Learning:** Implements a linear regression model to predict house prices.
- **Model Evaluation:** Uses Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate the accuracy of the predictions.
- **Output Summary:** Saves the predicted vs. actual prices to a text file for comparison.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
